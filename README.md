gwt-d3
======

GWT wrapper around d3.js.

This library provides access to the [d3.js API](http://d3js.org/) to the Java and GWT community.

It is still in a developpement phase. We are paying efforts on covering almost 100% of relevant d3 API.

You can see a demo with the test cases (for API coverage) and some exemples:

This is an ugly app but still demonstrate potential of d3 and gwt-d3...
