gwt-d3 GWT wrapper around d3.js.
======

This library provides access to the [d3.js API](http://d3js.org/) to the Java and GWT community.

Goals of the library:
- provide access to relevant API of d3.js
- enrich the API to ease Java programming style of d3 (turns JS array into List, string constants to Enum, ...)
- make a bridge between GWT Widget API and d3 

It is still in a developpement phase. We are paying efforts on covering almost 100% of relevant d3 API.
You should not use it for production purpose since it's still experimental and may change unexpectedly.

You can see a demo with the test cases (for API coverage) and some exemples:

This is an ugly app but still demonstrate the potential of (gwt-)d3 


Roadmap:

1.0.0 (planned by the end of august)
