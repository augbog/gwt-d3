/**
 * A selection returned by a call to {@link UpdateSelection#enter()}.
 * <p>
 * The entering selection only contains placeholder nodes for each data element for which no corresponding existing DOM element was found in the current selection.
 * <p>
 * In addition, the entering selection only defines append, insert and select operators; you must use these operators to instantiate the entering nodes before modifying any
 * content.
 * <p>
 * Note that the enter operator merely returns a reference to the entering selection, and it is up to you to add the new nodes.
 * <p>
 * The enter selection <strong>merges into the update selection</strong> when you append or insert. This approach reduces code duplication between enter and update. Rather than
 * applying operators to both the enter and update selection separately, you can now apply them to the update selection after entering the nodes. In the rare case that you want to
 * run operators only on the updating nodes, you can run them on the update selection before entering new nodes.
